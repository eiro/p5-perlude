    * lines rewritten
        * now uses open_file, so much richier prototype
        * no longer relies on &records

            in the first era of Perlude, it was decided to reuse a lot of
            Perlude to write Perlude. that's why we used apply {} on records. 

            however, i broken this law for lines because: 

            * this part of Perlude is stable for years now
            * lines performance is critical enough to break laws
